org.ntlab.deltaExtractor
===============

Delta extractor that is available on a trace-based debugger. 
The trace-based debugger was developped as an Eclipse plug-in that extends [our trace analysis platform](https://github.com/nitta-lab/org.ntlab.traceAnalysisPlatform). 
It can read a trace file collected by our trace analysis platform and can traverse the trace in the forward/reverse direction of the program execution.
