===============

Delta extractor that is available on a trace-based debugger. 
The trace-based debugger was developed as an Eclipse plug-in that extends [our trace analysis platform](https://github.com/nitta-lab/org.ntlab.traceAnalysisPlatform). 
The debugger can read a trace file collected by our trace analysis platform and provides a debugger-like UI that allow the user to traverse the trace in the forward/reverse direction of the program execution.

This plug-in is distributed under the LGPL.
